\section{Introduction}
In this report, we present the development of Distributed Multi-Server Chat System --- codename \textbf{Strike} --- which we discuss especially in the context of Distributed Algorithms. The objective of the project is to get learning experiences by critical reading and experimenting on a small set of papers that are on an original (set of) distributed algorithms.

%\subsection{Background}
%This report is prepared for the term project assessment of \textit{COMP90020 Distributed Algorithms Semester 1 2017, The University of Melbourne}. 

%\subsection{Idea and Approach}
To undertake the project objective, we start by brainstorming a possible application that can give us challenging opportunity to touch base with Distributed Algorithms. Our team have gone through a couple of proposed idea and, we have finalised into developing a Chat System which comprises of \emph{N-number of clients} and \emph{N-number of servers}. We hypothesize that building \emph{many clients to many servers} and, \emph{server to server communication within a cluster} can produce great learning exposure to demonstrate developing Distributed Systems and Distributed Algorithms. 
% as in most possible real world setting.

%In the following sections, we discuss how we achieve the project objective by discussing the survey, %comparative analysis and implementation details about Application Logic and System Architecture, %Protocol Design, Communication Sub-system, Multi-threading and Concurrency.

In the following sections, we start our discussion on the Application Logic where the Strike System lay the foundation. Then we move on to discuss our main topics on Failure Detection, Leader Election and Consensus algorithms. At the end, we conclude with the observation of hybrid approach of these three algorithms to demonstrate how one can implement reliable fault-tolerant and eventual consistency in distributed systems.
